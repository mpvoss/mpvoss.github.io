                You've probably seen magic mirrors like the above around the internet. They are a very fun RaspberryPi project and I learned quite a bit from building one for myself and one as a gift. I'll separate the software and hardware parts of the build for those who are only interested in one or the other.

                <br><br>

                    <h3>Hardware: Materials</h3>
                </center>
                First step in this project is to find a decent monitor on Craigslist/Letgo or similar services. This project is not cheap so it's good to cut costs when you can, and usually you can get a good, bright LED monitor for $30-$45 if you don't already have one laying around.
                <br><br>Once you have a monitor you will know what size housing you need to build. The rest of the materials needed are:

                <ul>
                    <li>2 way mirror</li>
                    <li>RaspberryPi 3b (with power supply, case for pi)</li>
                    <li>2 plug power strip</li>
                    <li>Angle bracket to secure the monitor</li>
                    <li>Wood for the housing</li>
                    <li>Fan for ventilation</li>
                    <li>Small furniture pads</li>
                    <li>Velcro for securing pi</li>
                    <li>Picture hanging fastener/hanging cable</li>

                </ul>

                <h4>Wood considerations</h4>
                For my first magic mirror I used pine because it was cheap. This is fine if you want to paint it or want a light stain, but pine does not take dark stains well at all.
                <br>
                <br> For my Mom's magic mirror I used oak and had much much better results with staining, so be sure to pick a wood that will work well for the finishing that you have in mind.

                    <h3>Hardware: Building the frame</h3>
                </center>
                The basic construction of the mirror housing is very simple. I just used 3.5" x 0.75" boards for the main housing and 1.5" x 0.75" boards for the frame. This gives it a nice overlap to keep the mirror and monitor in place. <br><br> Shout out to the Dallas Maker Space where I put this together. If you're in DFW and need a place to do handy work like this they have a wonderful workshop. They have all the tools you could ever need for wood working, welding, lazer cutting, electrical work...etc. Great place with very smart people.

                <br><br> Back to the project.<br><br> The main features of the housing that I want to highlight are the ventilation holes on the bottom and the ventilation square on the top.

                <br><br> My first magic mirror was running very hot with just the holes in the bottom, so I added a hole in the top and picked up some small fans to fasten to the hole and that helped tremendously.

                <br>

                <center><img height="450 px" alt="" src="images/mom_mirror_dry_fit.jpg" /></center>

                <br><br> Always a good idea to do a "dry fit" to make sure the monitor fits how you want it to before staining/painting. Above is my picture of the first time I put the monitor in the housing. Good fit! I could have made it a little smaller but this is fine.
                <br>
                <br> On my first attempt at a magic mirror made the box to small and ended up breaking the monitor trying to force it into place. On the next attempt I made the box too big, and although it still works just fine you can definitely see where the monitor ends inside the box, and I had to add spacers to keep the monitor in the center.

                    <h3>Hardware: Sanding, staining</h3>
                </center>

                Most of my mom's furniture is a reddish brown stain and I wanted this mirror to match. I found a red mahagony stain at Lowes and tried it out on a small sample piece which was cut from the same boards I was planning to use. This is very important!

                <center><img height="450 px" alt="" src="images/mom_mirror_sample.jpg" /></center>

                <br><br> You do NOT want to go to the trouble of buying, cutting, assembling, and staining your housing just to find that it's not the color you want. This way I was able to see how many coats of stain I needed and what the polyeurathane finish I had chosen would look like.
                <br><br> I liked how the sample looked, so then it was time to stain the real thing!
                <br>


                <center><img height="450 px" alt="" src="images/mom_mirror_stain_in_progress.jpg" /></center>
                <br><br> I highly reccomend laying down some durable plastic (two or more layers, if possible). It is cheap, protects your floor, and you can throw it away when you are done. <br><br> For easy staining I like to tap 4 small nails into the back of the mirror. This way you can stain the mirror while it "stands up" on the nails and it's much easier to get the bottom edge. The stain can also drip off instead of congealing against the plastic, so you'll get a smoother product.
                <br><br> Those nails can poke through the plastic though! Which is why using multiple layers of plastic is important. If you really wanted to you could lay some cardboard in between two layers of plastic, so the nails stop there and any leak-through stain doesn't get to the floor.
                <br><br>
