me:Okay, ready to test some of the stuff I taught you?
ai:Yeah scrub let's do this!
me:You remember to consider material and piece position, right?
ai:Sure whatever come on I'm totally going to beat you this time!
me:Whatever you say buddy. *plays a simple pawn opening, AI does the same, Matthew moves knight out*
ai:*moves queen out along an open diagonal, straight towards the middle rank*
ai:AWWW YEAH I CAN SEE THE WHOLE BOARD FROM HERE!!! You're so toast man I'm like totally winning in this position
me:Ummm...it's like move 3.  You're not supposed to move your queen out early in chess...
ai:Huh? IDK man I've got two heuristics right here and one of them says more available moves = super beast mode.
ai:I think you just said that because you only have like 3 available moves. Get on my level puny human.
