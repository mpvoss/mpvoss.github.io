               <br>
               Projects like trying to “solve” the market are fun because there’s a lot of data/literature out there already, the technical challenges are very interesting, and there’s always the 0.00000000001% chance that if you succeed you can get super mega rich.  It’s for these reasons that I tried my hand at writing a stock market AI a while back.
               The goal?  Develop heuristics or some kind of training model that could make money in a simulated environment.  I chose Python for this project because it’s fun to use and I wanted more experience with it. <br><br>
               More quantitatively, I wanted to see at least an 8% ROI on average.  You can usually get that with a low cost index fund so any other approach that’s more effort should earn at least that.<br>

                  <h3>Attempt #1: Genetic Algorithm (basic)</h3>
               </center>
               This attempt was mostly to develop a framework for getting the data I needed and running models against training data.  <br><br>
               Genetic algorithms simulate evolution by breaking solutions to a problem into "genomes" that you can mutate and combine with other genomes.  You then measure the "fitness" (or how good the solution is) and let fit genomes spread among your populations while the weak solutions are removed.
               <br><br>
               Genetic algorithms are often a good fit for problems with massive solution spaces that can't be searched exhaustively.  This is because their random mutations can stumble onto great answers that you couldn't have found iteratively.  As such, it seemed like a good fit for this problem<br><br>

                  <h3>Data acquisition</h3>
               </center>
               I used the PandasDatareader library for downloading stock prices from the Yahoo Finance API.  This was very fast and easy and I saved off the fields I needed to a local postgres database so I didn’t need to wait on data downloads for every test.
               <br><br>
               While my goal was to randomly pick 18 months of data for the AI to train on, then validate it against the next 12 months of data, my random timeframes overlapped with the various financial crises surprisingly often.  For this reason I mostly used the 2009 - 2015 time frame to get a stable framework and then widened it up a bit.  I figured most of Wall Street was bested by the 2008 housing bubble and the 2000 dot com bust, it was okay if my little python project got hosed by them as well. <br><br>
               I took random samples from the S&P 500, kindly provided <a href="https://github.com/datasets/s-and-p-500-companies">here</a>.
               <center>
                  <h3>AI Model</h3>
               </center>
               My first heuristic was quite basic.  Each agent in my population had
               <ul>
                  <li> buyThreshold: The percentage increase over the mean of the training data that was needed before the agent would buy the stock.  This was a conservative approach that was mostly hoping to milk the natural ebs and wanes of the market.</li>
                  <li>maxLoss: the most a stock price can drop below the buy-in point before an agent would sell the stock and bail out.</li>
                  <li>desiredProfit: How much the AI wants to make before it sells a stock.</li>
               </ul>
               <br><br>
               Now all that's left is to randomize a population and let it discover the next best stock strategy!  The main loop for the simulation is thus:
               <center>
                  <h3>DO SOMETHING ALREADY</h3>
               </center>
               As is usually the case with Genetic Algorithms, one of my biggest issues was tuning the heuristic and mutation parameters.  Either there wasn’t enough exploration and nothing ever evolved that was more fit than the initial batch or it explored too wildly and never refined itself into good matches.
               <br><br>
               Clearly this model wasn’t really getting me anywhere interesting.  Time to upgrade my basic 3-parameter model.

                  <h3>Further experimentation</h3>
               </center>

If pursue this further I'd like to integrate with Quantopian or a similar service that allows for easy backtesting and massive datasets.

<br>
There's also a great knowledgebase in their forums and blog posts on algotrading techniques and methods.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/">Reddit's algotrading subreddit</a> is also a source of great information, if you're into this type of content.

<br><br>
Also a group of very smart people made a more robust suite of trading infrastructure tools called backtrader <a href="https://github.com/mementum/backtrader">here</a>.  My main goal with this project was to play with Python and integrate some db tools with genetic mutation and do some optimizing. If I actually wanted to make money I would probably use backtrader. ;)
